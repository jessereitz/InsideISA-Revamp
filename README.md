# InsideISA-Revamp

This project is the middle ground between the InsideISA email generator and the ISA Easy Email generator. This project, as well as the original InsideISA project, was created to allow my colleagues and I to create consistently styled and formatted HTML Emails. The in-house HTML email tool at my former company didn't allow for the easy sharing or reuse of templates so I figured I'd make a solution myself. 

This particular project builds on the above objective but provides a better experience for the user. Using content-editable HTML elements, I was able to build a what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) editor which is easy to use and shows the user exactly what their email is going to look like. They can then easily copy the HTML code to their clipboard and paste it into the in-house HTML email editor.
